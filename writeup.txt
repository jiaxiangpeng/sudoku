	genetic algorithm:
	first, generate number for each space randomly as sample for number of q
	second, randomly take two elements from sample for all the number, and exchange the random place and randomly transfer, generate new sample for number of q
	Third, take the previous generation of 2*q sample , calculate the every sample's evaluate function, choice the smallest sample to generate the next generation
	Fourth, keep generating until the zero conflict sample comes out, end or reach the maximum iteration
